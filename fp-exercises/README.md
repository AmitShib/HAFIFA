# Functional Programming Principles:
- ## Pure Functions:
  - Deterministic (same arguments -> same result)
  - No Side Effects

<br>

- ## Immutability (const only! no let!)

<br>

- ## Functions As First-Class Entities:
  - Refer To It From Constants And Variables
  - Pass It As A Parameter To Other Functions

<br>

- ## High-Order Functions:
  - Takes One Or More Functions As Parameters
  - Returns A Function As Its Result

<br>

- ## Declarative Programming (WHAT instead of HOW)
